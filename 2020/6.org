** Part One

#+begin_quote
For each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered "yes". What is the sum of
those counts?
#+end_quote

For each group, we can use a ~Bag~ to collect answers and the number of ~Bag~ keys will the
number of questions that have received at least one "yes" answer.

#+begin_src raku :results output
my $input = slurp '6-input.txt';

my @groups = $input.split("\n\n");

say [+] @groups.map(*.comb(/\w/).Bag.keys.elems)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 6416

** Part Two

#+begin_quote
For each group, count the number of questions to which everyone answered "yes". What is the sum
of those counts?
#+end_quote

In part two we can modify the ~Bag~ approach and count the number of entries that have a value
equal to the number of people in the group.

#+begin_src raku :results output
  my $input = slurp '6-input.txt';

  my @groups = $input.split("\n\n");

  say [+] @groups.map(
      -> $g {
          my @people = $g.lines;
          @people.comb(/\w/).Bag.values.grep(-> $v { $v == @people.elems }).elems
      })
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3050
