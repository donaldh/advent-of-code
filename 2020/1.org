This is a solution to Advent of Code 2020 day 1, written in Raku.

** Part One

#+begin_quote
Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle
input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.  Specifically, they need you to find the
two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.
#+end_quote

This problem can be solved nicely using combinations and the reduce meta operator.

#+begin_src raku :results output
my @values = '1-input.txt'.IO.lines;

say 'Part 1';
say [*] @values.combinations(2).grep({([+] $_) == 2020 }).head;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Part 1
: 181044

** Part Two

#+begin_quote
In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
#+end_quote

The solution to part two is the same as part one, using combinations of 3 values instead
of 2.

#+begin_src raku :results output
my @values = '1-input.txt'.IO.lines;

say 'Part 2';
say [*] @values.combinations(3).grep({([+] $_) == 2020 }).head;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Part 2
: 82660352
