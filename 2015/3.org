** Part One

#+begin_quote
Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses ...

How many houses receive at least one present?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src raku :results output
my $input = slurp '3-input.txt';
my $x = 0;
my $y = 0;
my %houses;

%houses{"{$x}:{$y}"} += 1;

for $input.comb -> $move {
    given $move {
        when '>' { $x++; }
        when '<' { $x--; }
        when '^' { $y++; }
        when 'v' { $y--; }
    }
    %houses{"{$x}:{$y}"} += 1;
}
say +%houses.keys;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 2081


** Part Two

#+begin_quote
The next year, to speed up the process, Santa creates a robot version of himself, Robo-Santa, to
deliver presents with him.

Santa and Robo-Santa start at the same location (delivering two presents to the same starting
house), then take turns moving based on instructions from the elf, who is eggnoggedly reading
from the same script as the previous year.

This year, how many houses receive at least one present?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src raku :results output
my $input = slurp '3-input.txt';
my $sx = 0;
my $sy = 0;
my $rx = 0;
my $ry = 0;

my %houses;
%houses{"0:0"} += 2;

for $input.comb -> $s, $r {
    given $s {
        when '>' { $sx++; }
        when '<' { $sx--; }
        when '^' { $sy++; }
        when 'v' { $sy--; }
    }
    %houses{"{$sx}:{$sy}"} += 1;

    given $r {
        when '>' { $rx++; }
        when '<' { $rx--; }
        when '^' { $ry++; }
        when 'v' { $ry--; }
    }
    %houses{"{$rx}:{$ry}"} += 1;
}
say +%houses.keys;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 2341
