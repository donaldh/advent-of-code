** Part One

#+begin_quote
The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They
have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want
to order exactly as much as they need ...

All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should
they order?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src raku :results output
my $total = 0;
for '2-input.txt'.IO.lines {
    my @dims = .split('x')>>.Num.sort;
    my @sides = @dims.combinations(2);
    $total += ([+] @sides>>.reduce(&infix:<*>)) * 2;
    $total += @sides[0].reduce(&infix:<*>);
}
say "{$total} square feet of wrapping paper";
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1586300 square feet of wrapping paper

** Part Two

#+begin_quote
How many total feet of ribbon should they order?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src raku :results output
my $total = 0;
for '2-input.txt'.IO.lines {
    my @dims = .split('x')>>.Num.sort;
    $total += ([+] @dims[0,1]) * 2;
    $total += [*] @dims;
}
say "{$total} feet of ribbon";
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3737498 feet of ribbon
