** Part One

#+begin_quote
Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice ...

How many strings are nice?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src raku :results output
my $nice = 0;
for '5-input.txt'.IO.lines {
    next if +.match(/<[aeiou]>/, :exhaustive) < 3;
    next unless .match(/(\w)$0/);
    next if .contains('ab') or .contains('cd') or .contains('pq') or .contains('xy');
    # .say
    $nice++;
}
say "Found {$nice} nice strings";
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Found 255 nice strings

** Part Two

#+begin_quote
Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a
string is naughty or nice ...

How many strings are nice under these new rules?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src raku :results output
my $nice = 0;
for '5-input.txt'.IO.lines {
    next unless .match(/(\w\w).*$0/);
    next unless .match(/(\w)\w$0/);
    $nice++;
}
say "Found {$nice} nice strings";
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Found 55 nice strings
