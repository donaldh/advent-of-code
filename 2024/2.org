** Part One

#+begin_quote
Analyze the unusual data from the engineers. How many reports are safe?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src raku :results output
my @lines = 'input-2.txt'.IO.lines>>.split(/\s+/);

say [+] @lines.map(
    -> @levels {
        ([<] @levels or [>] @levels) and        # in increasing/decreasing order
        [&&] (@levels <<-<< @levels[1..*]).map( # difference between successive pairs
            -> $n { 1 <= abs($n) <= 3 }         # $n is in the valid range
        )
    });
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 213


** Part Two

#+begin_quote
Update your analysis by handling situations where the Problem Dampener can remove a single level
from unsafe reports. How many reports are now safe?
#+end_quote

#+begin_src raku :results output
my @lines = 'input-2.txt'.IO.lines>>.split(/\s+/);

sub is-safe(@levels) {
    ([<] @levels or [>] @levels) and
    [&&] (@levels <<-<< @levels[1..*]).map(
        -> $n { 1 <= abs($n) <= 3 }
    )
}

say [+] @lines.map(
    -> @levels {
        is-safe(@levels) or   # is original list safe
        [||] (^+@levels).map( # is any sub-list safe
            -> $pos {
                # sub-list omitting $pos
                is-safe(@levels[0..^$pos, $pos+1..*].flat)
            }
        )
    });
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 285
