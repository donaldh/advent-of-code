** Part One

#+begin_quote
Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?
#+end_quote

The input text has several lines per Elf, with a single calorie value per line. The lines for
each Elf are split by a double newline. We need to calculate the sum of the calorie values for
each Elf and then find the maximum.

#+begin_src raku :results output
# Build a list of lists of calorie values per Elf.
# Split the input by Elf and then split again by line
my @elves = '1-input.txt'.IO.split("\n\n")>>.lines;

# Reduce each Elf list to its total and find the maximum
say max @elves>>.sum;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 68923


** Part Two

#+begin_quote
Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are those Elves carrying
in total?
#+end_quote

Instead of finding the maximum, we need to sort the list of totals and take the top three. Then
we can report the sum of those three totals.

#+begin_src raku :results output
my @elves = '1-input.txt'.IO.split("\n\n")>>.lines;

# Reduce, sort and sum the top three
say @elves>>.sum.sort.tail(3).sum;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 200044
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 200044
